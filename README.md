# Security-501-Tester-program
This program is designed as a way to test your knowledge of questions that will show on the Comptia Security+ Exam. 

Put both files in the same directory then run the python script. Enter a number for the amount of questions you want for the test.
The program will then randomly pick that many questions to provide to you. Read the prompts and answer by typing in the 
correct letter. At the end the program scores the test and provides a list of any questions that were answered incorrect.
A user can type the question number to review the question and its answer, currently in its array format to provide debugging.
